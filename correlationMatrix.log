Understanding Correlation Coefficients
Correlation values range from -1 to 1:
1 indicates a perfect positive correlation: As one variable increases, the other variable also increases.
-1 indicates a perfect negative correlation: As one variable increases, the other variable decreases.
0 indicates no correlation: There is no linear relationship between the variables.

Temperature (AT) and Energy Output (PE) have a very strong negative correlation (-0.948), meaning as the temperature increases, the energy output significantly decreases.
Exhaust Vacuum (V) and Energy Output (PE) also show a strong negative correlation (-0.870).
Ambient Pressure (AP) and Energy Output (PE) show a moderate positive correlation (0.518), indicating that higher ambient pressure is moderately associated with higher energy output.
Relative Humidity (RH) and Energy Output (PE) have a weak positive correlation (0.390).
